        Compute the neighbor list for the system defined by ``positions``, ``box``, and

        ``quantities`` can contain any combination of the following values:

        - ``"i"`` to get the index of the first point in the pair
        - ``"j"`` to get the index of the second point in the pair
        - ``"p"`` to get the indexes of the two points in the pair simultaneously
        - ``"S"`` to get the periodic shift of the pair
        - ``"d"`` to get the distance between points in the pair
        - ``"D"`` to get the distance vector between points in the pair

            garbage collected or used to run a new calculation.
