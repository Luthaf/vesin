This is a small test suite for vesin, composed of:
- water.xyz: a medium-sized cluster
- napthalene.xyz: a small organic molecule
- diamond.xyz: a periodic system with a cubic cell
- carbon.xyz: a periodic system with a non-cubic cell

TODO: add systems with boundary conditions along some directions, but not others
